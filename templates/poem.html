            <h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>
            <h3>by Robert Frost</h3>
            <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
            <br>And sorry I could not travel both
            <br>And be one traveler, long I stood
            <br>And looked down one as far as I could
            <br>To where it bent in the undergrowth;
            <br>
            <br>Then took the other, as just as fair,
            <br>And having perhaps the better claim,
            <br>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
            <br>Though as for that the passing there
            <br>Had worn them really about the same,
            <br>
            <br>And both that morning equally lay
            <br>In leaves no step had trodden black.
            <br>Oh, I kept the first for another day!
            <br>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
            <br>I doubted if I should ever come back.
            <br>
            <br>I shall be telling this with a sigh
            <br>Somewhere ages and ages hence:
            <br>Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
            <br>I took the one less traveled by,
            <br>And that has made all the difference.</p>
